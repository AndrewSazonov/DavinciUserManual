\chapter{Introduction}

\textbf{Davinci} is a free scientific software for the visualization and processing of single-crystal diffraction data measured with a point detector.

\section{What Is Davinci For?}
%===========================================================

\textbf{Davinci} allows to obtain the squares of the structure factors (\(F^2_\text{obs}\)) based on the calculation of integrated intensities of the measured Bragg peaks. \(F^2_\text{obs}\) are required for structure determination with the crystallographic software \textbf{FullProf}, \textbf{Jana2006}, \textbf{ShelX}, etc.

\section{Davinci Features}
%===========================================================

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Cross-platform}\\	
	Davinci works across operating systems. You can download precompiled binaries of \textbf{Davinci Installer} for \textbf{macOS}, \textbf{Windows} and \textbf{Linux} operating systems, or you can get the source code and build the program yourself.
	\item \textbf{Easy to use}\\
	Intuitive tabbed interface helps to speed up the treatment of the complete dataset or individual peaks.
	\item \textbf{Various supported instruments}\\
	Davinci accepts the data from \textbf{POLI}, \textbf{HEiDi} and \textbf{MIRA} at \textbf{MLZ} as well as \textbf{6T2} at \textbf{LLB} and \textbf{TriCS} at \textbf{SINQ}.
	\item \textbf{Different peak integrations}\\
	The conventional and Lehmann-Larsen algorithms for the definition of the peak and background parameters.
	\item \textbf{Build-in text editor}\\
	Simplify the analysis of the experimental log and data files.
	\item \textbf{Multiple output formats}\\
	Davinci allows to save the modified input file (txt), extracted peak plots (jpg, pdf) as well as the hkl table (txt).
